# Starting with HTML
From now on, I will be posting the HTML Documents as well as Python Documents in the form of GitHub Repositories.
So, First of all, Let's talk about the Requirements for HTML:
```
Notepad
```
```
Visual Studio Code makes it very easy to code in HTML and is most preferred
```
Please note that every HTML file has an extension as .htm or .html

The HTML File in the Files Section is the Boiler Plate (the must codes of every HTML File).

Please save it as it would be important in every HTML File!
